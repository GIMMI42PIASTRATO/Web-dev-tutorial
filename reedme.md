# Web Development Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing all of my exercises and lessons as I learn web development. You will find a variety of projects, from simple HTML/CSS exercises to more complex JavaScript applications.

Please note that while I am primarily focused on learning web development, I may also include exercises and lessons related to backend development. However, at this time, I am not certain if I will be keeping the backend exercises in this repository or creating a separate one.

I hope that this repository will be a helpful resource for anyone who is also learning web development. If you have any feedback or suggestions for future exercises, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting!
